this script is in python. right now, it does lambda calculus with a very specific syntax. the syntax is like
((λvar.(_)) (var2))
you can replace var1, var2, and _ with any of these:
a, (λa.(_)), (_ _)
this is a project i created myself. 
a new file will be added: C_type later, which processes the user interface and makes it able to become a web app.
